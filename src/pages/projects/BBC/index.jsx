          <b>BBC Trips</b> is a website that provides young audiences (18-24
          years old) with relevant travel inspiration ranging from places to
          see, where to eat, guides, tips & more. It also serves as a platform
          to introduce them to existing travel content available across the BBC.

        <StyledP>
          The <strong>BBC</strong> is the worldâ€™s leading public service
          broadcaster & its core purpose is to
          <strong> provide a universal service</strong>. They provide a wide
          range of programmes, content & services for all audiences on
          television, radio & digitally.

        <StyledP>
          However, a challenge they are currently facing is engaging younger
          audiences & initial efforts have been made by commissioning content
          aimed at younger audiences on BBC iPlayer & introducing the dedicated
          BBC Sounds platform for on-demand radio, music & podcasts.

              - BBC currently provides travel content across their platforms.
              However, while they have a journalism product called BBC Travel,
              there is no dedicated platform for travel inspiration aimed at
              young adults.

          Research into the behavior, needs & motivations of the current young
          generation (Generation Z) was conducted to get a clear image of who
          the user could be. The information collected was used to create user
          personas which served as guidelines to create the optimal experience &
          ensure that all decisions concerning the design, functionality &
          content are targeting the right people.
