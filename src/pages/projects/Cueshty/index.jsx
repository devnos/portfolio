        <StyledP>
          <b>Cueshty</b> is a hybrid nightlife & activity venue for students
          with a fun & playful vibe that is inspired by the Memphis design
          movement of the 80s & 90s.

        <Subheader>The Challenge</Subheader>
        <StyledP>
          Following the success of other hybrid nightlife/activity companies in
          Glasgow a client wants to launch a new bar/activity to the Glasgow
          area.
        </StyledP>
        <StyledP>
          They want to establish a brand for the new venue that is a mix of
          crazy golf & pool. Alongside the activity there will be a bar with
          drinks & food.{" "}
        </StyledP>
        <StyledP>
          They also want promotional material that advertises the activity
          effectively with a consistent style & theme.
        </StyledP>
        <Subheader>What Does the Research Say?</Subheader>
        <StyledP>
          Research was performed by taking a look at existing crazy golf & pool
          venues to see how they portray themselves online. Crazy golf venues
          had more of a fun & playful theme while pool venues were darker &
          seemed to be targeted at males.
        </StyledP>
        <StyledP>
          There was an opportunity to bring the fun & playful theme to the new
          crazy pool venue.

        <Subheader>Generating Ideas & Creating Moodboards</Subheader>
        <StyledP>
          To create a fun & playful brand it was decided to look at the 80s/90s.
          This included looking at 80s & 90s inspired designs, as well as brands
          in the 80s/90s & existing venues with similar design. The Memphis
          design style was prominent in these decades & some patterns emerged
          from this research which can be seen below.
        </StyledP>
        <Subheader>Developing the Ideas</Subheader>
        <StyledP>
          The moodboard inspired the creation of the logo seen below which has
          clear design references to the 80s/90s.
        </StyledP>
        <Subheader>✏️ Logo Development</Subheader>
        <StyledP>
          After creating the initial logo another moodboard was created to
          analyze modern takes on 80s/90s inspired design as the client
          expressed that the logo felt quite outdated. Analyzing these revealed
          common techniques.
        </StyledP>
        <StyledP>
          This led to redesigns, exploration & the generation of more logo
          variations.
        </StyledP>
        <Subheader>⚙️ Asset Generation</Subheader>
        <StyledP>
          Assets were created to help establish the brand. These were inspired
          by the Memphis design style, golf & pool elements such as cues & pool
          racks & typical nightlife bar elements such as burgers, fries &
          drinks.
        </StyledP>
        <Subheader>The Final Brand</Subheader>
        <StyledP>
          The final brand is fun & playful as the venue is a hybrid nightlife &
          activity venue for students. It is a nod to the Memphis design
          movement of the 80s & 90s.
        </StyledP>
        <StyledP>
          The logo has the modern techniques reminiscent of the 80s & 90s by
          using a typeface with a colored drop-shadow & a triangle that reminds
          of a pool rack & Memphis design.
        </StyledP>
        <Subheader>Promotional Material</Subheader>
        <StyledP>
          Having an online presence is important as young people like to engage
          with brands on social media platforms. Therefore, ads were created for
          the Instagram format.
        </StyledP>
        <StyledP>
          Non-digital promotional material was created as well to show how the
          brand can be applied to more traditional mediums. As the target
          audience is students, some promotional material appropriate for
          student events like freshers’ week such as flyers & posters on stands
          were created.
        </StyledP>
        <StyledP>
          The logo is placed on a dark background to create contrast & the brand
          elements are placed in the background with low opacity.
        </StyledP>
